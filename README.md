<h1>itch.io CSS Assets</h1>
This repository contains a collection of custom CSS snippets designed to enhance and personalize itch.io pages. Each script can be easily applied to give your game pages or profile page a unique look and feel, whether you want to change layouts, adjust typography, or add playful visual effects. This Project is WIP.

<h1>Features</h1>
<p>This repo includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A cleaner image viewer with a grid layout</li>
  <li>Improved buttons and a polished game-canvas look</li>
  <li>An example of a parallax-like background effect</li>
  <li>An example using a custom font and cursor</li>
  <li>A completely redesigned profile page</li>
  <li>... and so much more</li>
</ul>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>
  You can use these styles by importing them into your itch.io page, like this:
  <br>
  <b>@import url("https://baaatz07.github.io/ItchAssets/ProfilePage/style.css");</b>
</p>

<p>
  Then you can override any additional rules with the !important tag, for example:
  <br>
  <b>.a { background-color: green !important; }</b>
</p>

Of course, you can also clone this repo and modify the files directly.

<h1>Demo</h1>
<p>
  Feel free to explore the styles here and see them in action directly on my itch.io page: https://baaatz07.itch.io/
